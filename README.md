# What happened ?
As an explanation of the facts found, the main problem is in the problematic stock updates and not as reported. Some of the possible causes include:
1. Stock cutting is done when the user enters the item into the cart but at checkout, the cut stock is not re-validated.
2. The item stock report is not realtime.
Then because of the many canceled orders, the customer was very disappointed. This is of course very damaging to the image of the company.

# So what can we do ?
Then how to at least reduce the possibility of this problem occurring? I think what can be done is:
1. Re-validate the deduction of the item stock when making a transaction number.
2. Create an automatic cancel order feature if the customer does not make a payment according to the specified deadline. And of course the stock returns.
3. Create realtime stock reports.
